This project demonstrates a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) implemented for road segmentation from aerial drone imagery.
The model identifies and highlights drivable road regions in drone-captured images, contributing towards the automation of autonomous drone navigation and mapping systems.

The network processes images pixel by pixel, classifying each pixel as part of the road or non-road region — effectively learning to understand high-level scene structures through end-to-end semantic segmentation.

 Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) architecture built from scratch and trained using drone road datasets.

Pixel-wise road segmentation for aerial/drone vision tasks.

 Uses deep learning-based perception to understand top-down imagery.

 Trained and evaluated inside Kaggle environment for reproducibility.

 Integrated visualization pipeline to compare input drone image, ground truth mask, and predicted segmentation.

Dataset included in this repository as a ZIP folder for ease of access.
